        <h1>DBSchools Music Gradebook</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Music Gradebook helps music teachers and their aides assess music students on their
                instruments and record their progress through a book or series of books
                such as the <a href="http://www.brucepearsonmusic.com/method/enhanced/">
                Standard of Excellence</a> series. </p>

            <p>This program has been in regular use
                at <a title="external-link" href="http://stanleymusic.org/">Stanley Middle School</a>
                since the 2004â€“05 school year.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Has a customizable set of criteria used for assessing: Articulation, dynamics, etc.</li>
                <li>Knows the tempo of all pieces, and pre-sets a metronome to that value</li>
                <li>Shows a grid of the number of players in each band, by instrument</li>
                <li>Allows viewing all students, or any combination of band and instrument</li>
                <li>Has a page designed for projection on a screen in the main band room, which
                shows all students selected for testing, and calls them for testing when
                it is their turn</li>
                <li>Shows a history of assessments, which is useful for identifying problems,
                looking for trends, and grading</li>
                <li>Imports students from student information systems</li>
                <li>Helps with the selection of students to test, by showing the students
                in order of last test, from least recent (or never) to most recent</li>
                <li>Allows the users to chat with each other</li>
                <li>Clearly shows the state of the process: which students are in with which
                testers and when they started the session, and who is to be tested next</li>
                <li>Shows a summary of tests by teacher by day, and details about tests: who,
                when, what piece, pass/fail, and predefined and free-form comments</li>
                <li>Shows the number of tests and pass/fail ratios by group, grade, and tester</li>
            </ul>
