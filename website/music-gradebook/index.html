        <h1>DBSchools Music Gradebook</h1>

        <div>
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Music Gradebook helps music teachers and their aides assess music students on their
                instruments and record their progress through a book or series of books
                such as the <a href="http://www.brucepearsonmusic.com/method/enhanced/">
                Standard of Excellence</a> series. </p>

            <p>This program has been in regular use
                at <a title="external-link" href="http://stanleymusic.org/">Stanley Middle School</a>
                since the 2004â€“05 school year.</p>

            <p>It has a page, which, when projected on a screen, automatically calls students
                in for testing with one or more testers.</p>

            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>This is free software. <a href="https://github.com/dcbriccetti/dbschools">Source code.</a>
                <a href="https://github.com/dcbriccetti/dbschools/commits/master/music-gradebook">Change history.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Anyone can run it on their own computers.
                DBSchools will be glad to host it for a few groups who want to work
                with us now, giving feedback and helping us make Music Gradebook more generally useful.</p>
